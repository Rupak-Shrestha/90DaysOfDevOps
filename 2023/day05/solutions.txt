1.Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.

Example 1: When the script is executed as

./createDirectories.sh day 1 90

then it creates 90 directories as day1 day2 day3 .... day90

Example 2: When the script is executed as

./createDirectories.sh Movie 20 50 then it creates 50 directories as Movie20 Movie21 Movie23 ...Movie50

#!/bin/bash

#making multiple directories at once

DIR_NAME=$1
START_NUM=$2
END_NUM=$3

for((i=$START_NUM;i<=$END_NUM;i++))
do
	mkdir $DIR_NAME$i
done


2.Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.

#!/bin/bash

#backing up a folder

BACKUP_THIS=/home/wroopaq/DevOps/Shell-scripting/my_files
BACKUP_HERE=/home/wroopaq/DevOps/Shell-scripting/my_backup
BACKUP_DATE=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S")
BACKUP_FILE_NAME=$BACKUP_HERE/$BACKUP_DATE.tgz

echo 'Backup in progress'

echo "$BACKUP_DATE"
echo "$BACKUP_FILE_NAME"

tar czf $BACKUP_FILE_NAME --absolute-names $BACKUP_THIS

echo 'Backup complete'


3. to automate the backup Script

*  * * * * bash /home/wroopaq/DevOps/Shell-scripting/backup.sh

4.Create 2 users and just display their Usernames
-> To create user without home directory: sudo useradd user1
-> To create user with howe directory: sudo useradd -m user2
-> To add password to the user: sudo passwd user1
